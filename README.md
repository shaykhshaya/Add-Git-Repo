# Favorite GitHub Repository

The application allows the user to add any GitHub repository in his Favorite-GitHub-Repository-List. The ADD SCREEN consists of two input textfields which allows the user to enter Owner Name and Repository Name. When the user presses the 'Add Repository' button, it fetches the particular repository through GitHub API and stores it in Local Room Database and is shown in the FIRST SCREEN, which inclues a Recycler View.
The user can directly open the GitHub webpage after clicking on the link symbol and it also features sharing of repository as well.
